Homework 4: Python and data analyses
===========================


1. Using python write a tool which generates a random subsampling tool
for sequences. Given a FASTA sequence database file, which has 100,000
sequences, generate a new file which is a random subset these
sequences selecting only 10% of them. Make this 10% an option in the
program so it is easy to change to 20%, etc.

See the script 'rand_shuffle_seqs.py' in the homework template
 
2. BLAST
